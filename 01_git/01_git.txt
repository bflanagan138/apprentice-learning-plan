Super cool stuff.
Now I'm updating it again to use rebase interactive

1. A scenario where merging is better than rebasing: 
a. Merging is better when submitting a pull request for review
b. Merging is better when wanting to maintain a more complete git history
2. A scenario where rebasing is better than merging:
a. When the changes are very minimal, such as correcting a minor spelling error
b. When changes prior to rebasing aren't substantial enough to warrant tracking separately
